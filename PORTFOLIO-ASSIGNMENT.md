# Portfolio Assignment for Class 5 - Code Review

Work in pairs to improve your portfolio.

No need to add each other as collaborators, just share the link to your portfolio repo with your partner, who will then fork and clone the repo. You'll do the same with their portfolio.

Start with code review. Spend the first 30 minutes looking over each other's portfolio code. Look for opportunities to improve the code base according to the best practices and concepts that we've covered in class so far, such as D.R.Y., elimination of corpse code, good organization of CSS, proper HTML indenting, use of semantic HTML, and so on.

Remember, good code review:
 - Focuses on the code, not the author
 - Asks "Why is it this way?" rather than criticizing
 - Will nitpick the details
 - Seeks to make the code more understandable
 - Embraces and congratulates best practices
 - Respects the work that went into the current product

 Also, seek to implement any lingering Class 4 portfolio goals if they are not yet complete.

Create descriptive GitHub Issues for the most important issues that should be addressed. In the issue, describe what you see, ask clarifying questions as needed, and link to the related line(s) of code in the repo.

Once you both have a few issues logged, pick one of your repos to stat with and start writing code together.

The Driver will work on the Navigator's codebase. The Navigator can talk them through what is where, and how changes should be made, and the Driver can implement them.

Switch after you've worked through a few issues. Switch back again (and again) if time allows.
